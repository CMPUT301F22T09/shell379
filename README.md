### Running Instructions:

2. Use as desired!

### Assumptions:
1. This app assumes that a stable internet connection is available to the user
2. This app is built to run on Android Oreo and above

### Comments:
1. Due to the usage of LiveData objects, testing was done heavily through the use of UI testing. This is primarily due to the fact that LiveData objects requires threading, which is not available in regular JUnit tests
3. UML and CRC Cards are under the wiki

### Known issues:
1. If you have run the app with a previous release, you may need to clear your local storage/ app data or the app may not function properly. A tutorial can be accessed here: https://www.cashify.in/how-to-clear-app-data-and-cache-on-android
